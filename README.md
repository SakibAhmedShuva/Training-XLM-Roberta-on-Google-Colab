# Training XLM-RoBERTa with spaCy on Google Colab

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for training XLM-RoBERTa models (base and large) on Google Colab using spaCy. These notebooks demonstrate how to set up the environment, load necessary libraries, and train the models effectively.

## Contents

- `training_xlm_roberta_base.ipynb`: Notebook for training the XLM-RoBERTa base model
- `training_xlm_roberta_large.ipynb`: Notebook for training the XLM-RoBERTa large model

## Prerequisites

- Google Colab account
- Google Drive account (for storing training data)
- GPU runtime enabled in Google Colab

## Usage

To use these notebooks:

1. Upload the desired notebook (`training_xlm_roberta_base.ipynb` or `training_xlm_roberta_large.ipynb`) to Google Colab.
2. Ensure your training data is available in your Google Drive.
3. Run the cells in order, adjusting paths and parameters as necessary.

Note: These notebooks require a GPU runtime in Google Colab for optimal performance.

## Local Setup (Optional)

If you prefer to run the notebooks locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SakibAhmedShuva/Training-XLM-Roberta-with-spaCy-on-Google-Colab.git
   cd Training-XLM-Roberta-with-spaCy-on-Google-Colab
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (it's recommended to use a virtual environment):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the desired notebook using Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook training_xlm_roberta_base.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```
   jupyter notebook training_xlm_roberta_large.ipynb
   ```
